The syllabi and textbooks developed on\\nthe basis of NCF signify an attempt to implement this basic idea. They\\nalso attempt to discourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp\\nboundaries between different subject areas. We hope these measures\\nwill take us significantly further in the direction of a child-centred system\\nof education outlined in the National Policy on Education (1986).\\nThe success of this effort depends on the steps that school\\nprincipals and teachers will take to encourage children to reflect on\\ntheir own learning and to pursue imaginative activities and questions.\\nWe must r ecognise that, given space, time and fr eedom, childr en\\ngenerate new knowledge by engaging with the information passed on\\nto them by adults. Treating the prescribed textbook as the sole basis\\nof examination is one of the key reasons why other resources and sites\\nof learning are ignored. Inculcating creativity and initiative is possible\\nif we perceive and treat children as participants in learning, not as\\nreceivers of a fixed body of knowledge.\\nThese aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode\\nof functioning. Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as\\nrigour in implementing the annual calendar so that the required\\nnumber of teaching days are actually devoted to teaching. The methods\\nused for teaching and evaluation will also determine how effective this\\ntextbook proves for making children’s life at school a happy experience,\\nrather than a source of stress or boredom. Syllabus designers have\\ntried to address the problem of curricular burden by restructuring\\nand reorienting knowledge at different stages with greater consideration\\nfor child psychology and the time available for teaching. The textbook\\nattempts to enhance this endeavour by giving higher priority and space\\nto opportunities for contemplation and wondering, discussion in small\\ngroups, and activities requiring hands-on experience.\\nThe National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT)\\nappreciates the hard work done by the textbook development committee\\nresponsible for this book. W e wish to thank the Chairperson of the\\nadvisory group in Social Sciences, Professor Hari Vasudevan, and the\\nChief Advisor for this book, Professor Neeladri Bhattacharya, Centre for\\nHistorical Studies, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi for guiding\\nthe work of this committee.

How\\nis it linked to what has been studied in earlier classes?\\nIn Classes VI to VIII we looked at Indian history from early\\nbeginnings to modern times, with a focus on one chronological\\nperiod in each year. Then in the books for Classes IX and X, the\\nframe of reference changed. We looked at a shorter period of time,\\nfocusing specifically on a close study of the contemporary world.\\nWe moved beyond territorial boundaries, beyond the limits of nation\\nstates, to see how different people in different places have played\\ntheir part in the making of the modern world. The history of India\\nbecame connected to a wider inter-linked history. Subsequently in\\nClass XI we studied Themes in W orld History , expanding our\\nchronological focus, looking at the vast span of years from the\\nbeginning of human life to the present, but selecting only a set of\\nthemes for serious exploration. This year we will study Themes in\\nIndian History.\\nThe book begins with Harappa and ends with the framing of the\\nIndian Constitution. What it offers is not a general survey of five\\nmillennia, but a close study of select themes. The history books in\\nearlier years have already acquainted you with Indian history. It is\\ntime we explored some themes in greater detail.\\nIn choosing the themes we have tried to ensure that we learn\\nabout developments in different spheres – economic, cultural, social,\\npolitical, and religious – even as we attempt to break the boundaries\\nbetween them. Some themes in the book will introduce you to the\\npolitics of the times and the nature of authority and power; others\\nexplore the way societies are organised, and the way they function\\nand change; still others tell us about religious life and ritual\\npractices, about the working of economies, and the changes within\\nrural and urban societies.\\nEach of these themes will also allow you to have a closer look at\\nthe historians’ craft. To retrieve the past, historians have to find\\nsources that make the past accessible. But sources do not just reveal\\nthe past; historians have to grapple with sources, interpret them,\\nand make them speak. This is what makes history exciting. The\\nsame sources can tell us new things if we ask new questions, and\\nengage with them in new ways. So we need to see how historians\\nread sources, and how they discover new things in old sources.\\nBut historians do not only re-examine old records. They discover\\nnew ones. Sometimes these could be chance discoveries.\\nArchaeologists may unexpectedly come across seals and mounds\\nthat provide clues to the existence of a site of an ancient civilisation.\\nRummaging through the dusty records of a district collectorate a\\nRationalised 2023-24\\n'),\n",

Yet are such discoveries only accidents? You\\nmay bump into a bundle of old records in an archive, open it up\\nand see it, without discovering the significance of the source. The\\nsource may mean nothing to you unless you have relevant questions\\nin mind. You have to track the source, read the text, follow the clues,\\nand make the inter-connections before you can reconstruct the past.\\nThe physical discovery of a record does not simply open up the\\npast. When Alexander Cunningham first saw a Harappan seal, he\\ncould make no sense of it. Only much later was the significance of\\nthe seals discovered.\\nIn fact when historians begin to ask new questions, explore new\\nthemes, they have to often search for new types of sources. If we\\nwish to know about revolutionaries and rebels, official sources can\\nreveal only a partial picture, one that will be shaped by official\\ncensure and prejudice. We need to look for other sources – diaries\\nof rebels, their personal letters, their writings and pronouncements.\\nAnd these are not always easy to come by. If we have to understand\\nexperiences of people, then oral sources might reveal more than\\nwritten sources.\\nAs the vision of history broadens, historians begin tracking new\\nsources, searching for new clues to understand the past. And when\\nthat happens, the conception of what constitutes a source itself\\nchanges. There was a time when only written records were\\nacknowledged as authentic. What was written could be verified,\\ncited, and cross-checked. Oral evidence was never considered a valid\\nsource: who was to guarantee its authenticity and verifiability? This\\nmistrust of oral sources has not yet disappeared, but oral evidence\\nhas been innovatively used to uncover experiences that no other\\nrecord could reveal.\\nThrough the book this year, you will enter the world of historians,\\naccompany them in their search for new clues, and see how they\\ncarry on their dialogues with the past. You will witness the way they\\ntease out meaning out of records, read inscriptions, excavate\\narchaeological sites, make sense of beads and bones, interpret the\\nepics, look at the stupas and buildings, examine paintings and\\nphotographs, interpret police reports and revenue records, and listen\\nto the voices of the past. Each theme will explore the peculiarities\\nand possibilities of one particular type of source. It will discuss what\\na source can tell and what it cannot.\\nThis is Part II, of Themes in Indian History. Part III will follow.\\nNEELADRI BHATTACHARY\\nA\\nChief Advisor, History\\nRationalised 2023-24\\n'),\n",

Al-Biruni and the\\nKitab-ul-Hind\\n1.1 From Khwarizm to the Punjab\\nAl-Biruni was born in 973, in Khwarizm in present-\\nday Uzbekistan. Khwarizm was an important centre\\nof learning, and Al-Biruni received the best\\neducation available at the time. He was well versed\\nin several languages: Syriac, Arabic, Persian,\\nHebrew and Sanskrit. Although he did not know\\nGreek, he was familiar with the works of Plato\\nand other Greek philosophers, having read\\nthem  in Arabic translations. In 1017, when Sultan\\nMahmud invaded Khwarizm,  he took several\\nscholars and poets back to his capital, Ghazni;\\nAl-Biruni was one of them. He arrived in Ghazni as\\na hostage, but gradually developed a liking for the\\ncity, where he spent the rest of his life until his\\ndeath at the age of 70.\\nIt was in Ghazni that Al-Biruni developed an\\ninterest in India. This was not unusual. Sanskrit\\nworks on astronomy, mathematics and medicine had\\nbeen translated into Arabic from the eighth century\\nonwards. When the Punjab became a part of the\\nGhaznavid empire, contacts with the local population\\nhelped create an environment of mutual trust and\\nunderstanding. Al-Biruni spent years in the company\\nof Brahmana priests and scholars, learning Sanskrit,\\nand studying religious and philosophical texts. While\\nhis itinerary is not clear, it is likely that he travelled\\nwidely in the Punjab and parts of northern India.\\nTravel literature was already an accepted part of\\nArabic literature by the time he wrote. This literature\\ndealt with lands as far apart as the Sahara desert\\nin the west to the River Volga in the north. So, while\\nTranslating texts,\\nsharing ideas\\nAl-Biruni’s expertise in several\\nlanguages allowed him to\\ncompare languages and\\ntranslate texts. He translated\\nseveral Sanskrit works, including\\nPatanjali’s work on grammar ,\\ninto Arabic. For his Brahmana\\nfriends, he translated the\\nworks of Euclid (a Greek\\nmathematician) into Sanskrit.\\nAl-Biruni’s objectives\\nAl-Biruni described his work as:\\na help to those who want to\\ndiscuss religious questions\\nwith them (the Hindus), and\\nas a repertory of information\\nto those who want to\\nassociate with them.\\nSource 1\\n/circleright  Read the excerpt from\\nAl-Biruni (Source 5) and\\ndiscuss whether his work\\nmet these objectives.\\nRationalised 2023-24\\n'),\n",

It is a voluminous text, divided into\\n80 chapters on subjects such as religion and\\nphilosophy, festivals, astronomy, alchemy, manners\\nand customs, social life, weights and measures,\\niconography, laws and  metrology.\\nGenerally (though not always), Al-Biruni adopted\\na distinctive structure in each chapter, beginning\\nwith a question, following this up with a description\\nbased on Sanskritic traditions, and concluding\\nwith a comparison with other cultures. Some\\npresent-day scholars have argued that this almost\\ngeometric structure, remarkable for its precision and\\npredictability, owed much to his mathematical\\norientation.\\nAl-Biruni, who wrote in Arabic, probably intended\\nhis work for peoples living along the frontiers of the\\nsubcontinent. He was familiar with translations\\nand adaptations of Sanskrit, Pali and Prakrit texts\\ninto Arabic – these ranged from fables to works on\\nastronomy and medicine.

Before he\\nset off for India in 1332-33, he had made pilgrimage\\ntrips to Mecca, and had already travelled extensively\\nin Syria, Iraq, Persia, Yemen, Oman and a few\\ntrading ports on the coast of East Africa.\\nTravelling overland through Central Asia, Ibn\\nBattuta reached Sind in 1333. He had heard\\nabout Muhammad bin Tughlaq, the Sultan of Delhi,\\nand lured by his reputation as a generous patron\\nof arts and letters, set off for Delhi, passing through\\nMultan and Uch. The Sultan was impressed by\\nhis scholarship, and appointed him the qazi  or judge\\nof Delhi. He remained in that position for several\\nyears, until he fell out of favour and was thrown\\ninto prison. Once the misunderstanding between\\nhim and the Sultan was cleared, he was\\nrestored to imperial service, and was\\nordered in 1342 to proceed to China as the\\nSultan’s envoy to the Mongol ruler.\\nWith the new assignment, Ibn Battuta\\nproceeded to the Malabar coast through\\ncentral India. From Malabar he went to\\nthe Maldives, where he stayed for eighteen\\nmonths as the qazi, but eventually decided\\nto proceed to Sri Lanka.

Making Sense of an Alien World\\nAl-Biruni and the Sanskritic\\nTradition\\n4.1 Overcoming barriers to understanding\\nAs we have seen, travellers often compared what\\nthey saw in the subcontinent with practices\\nwith which they were familiar. Each traveller\\nadopted  distinct strategies to understand what they\\nobserved.  Al-Biruni, for instance, was aware of the\\nproblems inherent in the task he had set himself.\\nHe discussed several “barriers” that he felt\\nobstructed understanding. The first amongst these\\nwas language. According to him, Sanskrit was so\\ndifferent from Arabic and Persian that ideas and\\nconcepts could not be easily translated from one\\nlanguage into another.\\nThe second barrier he identified was the difference\\nin religious beliefs and practices. The self-absorption\\nand consequent insularity of the local population\\naccording to him, constituted the third barrier.\\nWhat is interesting is that even though he was aware\\nof these problems, Al-Biruni depended almost\\nexclusively on the works of Brahmanas, often citing\\npassages from the Vedas, the Puranas, the Bhagavad\\nGita, the works of Patanjali, the Manusmriti, etc., to\\nprovide an understanding of Indian society.\\n4.2 Al-Biruni’s description of the caste system\\nAl-Biruni tried to explain the caste system by looking\\nfor parallels in other societies. He noted that in\\nancient Persia, four social categories were\\nrecognised: those of knights and princes; monks,\\nfire-priests and lawyers; physicians, astronomers\\nand other scientists; and finally, peasants and\\nartisans. In other words, he attempted to suggest\\nthat social divisions were not unique to India. At\\nthe same time he pointed out that within Islam all\\nmen were considered equal, differing only in their\\nobservance of piety.\\nIn spite of his acceptance of the Brahmanical\\ndescription of the caste system, Al-Biruni disapproved\\nof the notion of pollution. He remarked that\\neverything which falls into a state of impurity strives\\nand succeeds in regaining its original condition of\\npurity. The sun cleanses the air, and the salt in the\\nsea prevents the water from becoming polluted. If it\\nA language with an\\nenormous range\\nAl-Biruni described Sanskrit as\\nfollows:\\nIf you want to conquer this\\ndifficulty (i.e. to learn\\nSanskrit), you will not find\\nit easy , because the\\nlanguage is of an enormous\\nrange, both in words and\\ninflections, something like\\nthe Arabic, calling one and\\nthe same thing by various\\nnames, both original and\\nderivative, and using one\\nand the same word for a\\nvariety of subjects, which,\\nin order to be properly\\nunderstood, must be\\ndistinguished from each\\nother by various qualifying\\nepithets.\\nGod knows best!\\nTravellers did not always believe\\nwhat they were told. When\\nfaced with the story of a wooden\\nidol that supposedly lasted for\\n216,432 years, Al-Biruni asks:\\nHow, then, could wood\\nhave lasted such a length of\\ntime, and particularly in a\\nplace where the air and the\\nsoil are rather wet?

The conception of social\\npollution, intrinsic to the caste system, was\\naccording to him, contrary to the laws of nature.\\nThe system of varnas\\nThis is Al-Biruni’s account of the system of varnas:\\nThe highest caste are the Brahmana, of whom the\\nbooks of the Hindus tell us that they were created from\\nthe head of Brahman. And as the Brahman is only\\nanother name for the force called \\nnature, and the head\\nis the highest part of the … body , the Brahmana are the\\nchoice part of the whole genus. Therefore the Hindus\\nconsider them as the very best of mankind.\\nThe next caste are the Kshatriya, who were created,\\nas they say, from the shoulders and hands of Brahman.\\nTheir degree is not much below that of the Brahmana.\\nAfter them follow the Vaishya, who were created from\\nthe thigh of Brahman.\\nThe Shudra, who were created from his feet . . .\\nBetween the latter two classes there is no very\\ngreat distance. Much, however , as these classes\\ndiffer fr om each other , they live together in the\\nsame towns and villages, mixed together in the same\\nhouses and lodgings.\\nAs we have seen, Al-Biruni’s description of the\\ncaste system was deeply influenced by his study\\nof normative Sanskrit texts which laid down the rules\\ngoverning the system from the point of view of\\nthe Brahmanas. However, in real life the system\\nwas not quite as rigid. For instance, the categories\\ndefined as antyaja (literally, born outside the system)\\nwere often expected to provide inexpensive labour to\\nboth  peasants and zamindars (see also Chapter 8).\\nIn other words, while they were often subjected to\\nsocial oppression, they were included within\\neconomic networks.\\n/circleright  Discuss...\\nHow important is knowledge\\nof the language of the area for\\na traveller from a different\\nregion?\\nSource 5\\n/circleright  Compare what Al-Biruni\\nwrote with Source 6, Chapter 3.\\nDo you notice any similarities\\nand differences?

Ibn Battuta\\nfound Indian agriculture very productive because of\\nthe fertility of the soil, which allowed farmers to\\ncultivate two crops a year. He also noted that the\\nsubcontinent was well integrated with inter-Asian\\nnetworks of trade and commerce, with Indian\\nmanufactures being in great demand in both West Asia\\nand Southeast Asia, fetching huge profits for artisans\\nand merchants. Indian textiles, particularly cotton\\ncloth, fine muslins, silks, brocade and satin, were in\\ngreat demand. Ibn Battuta informs us that certain\\nvarieties of fine muslin were so expensive that they\\ncould be worn only by the nobles and the very rich.\\nMusic in the market\\nRead Ibn Battuta’s description of Daulatabad:\\nIn Daulatabad there is a market place for male and\\nfemale singers, which is known as T arababad. It is one\\nof the greatest and most beautiful bazaars. It has\\nnumerous shops and every shop has a door which\\nleads into the house of the owner ...

Almost all trade routes were\\nwell supplied with inns and guest houses. Ibn\\nBattuta was also amazed by the efficiency of the\\npostal system which allowed merchants to not only\\nsend information and remit credit across long\\ndistances, but also to dispatch goods required at\\nshort notice. The postal system was so efficient that\\nwhile it took fifty days to reach Delhi from Sind,\\nthe news reports of spies would reach the Sultan\\nthrough the postal system in just five days.\\nOn horse and on foot\\nThis is how Ibn Battuta describes the postal system:\\nIn India the postal system is of two kinds. The horse-\\npost, called \\nuluq, is run by royal horses stationed at a\\ndistance of every four miles. The foot-post has three\\nstations per mile; it is called \\ndawa, that is one-third of a\\nmile ...  Now , at every thir d of a mile ther e is a well-\\npopulated village, outside which are three pavilions in\\nwhich sit men with girded loins ready to start. Each of\\nthem carries a rod, two cubits in length, with copper\\nbells at the top. When the courier starts from the city\\nhe holds the letter in one hand and the rod with its\\nbells on the other; and he runs as fast as he can. When\\nthe men in the pavilion hear the ringing of the bell they\\nget ready. As soon as the courier r eaches them, one of\\nthem takes the letter from his hand and runs at top\\nspeed shaking the rod all the while until he reaches\\nthe next \\ndawa. And the same process continues till the\\nletter reaches its destination. This foot-post is quicker\\nthan the horse-post; and often it is used to transport\\nthe fruits of Khurasan which are much desired in India.\\n/circleright  Discuss...\\nHow did Ibn Battuta handle the problem of\\ndescribing things or situations to people who\\nhad not seen or experienced them?\\nA strange nation?\\nThe travelogue of Abdur Razzaq\\nwritten in the 1440s is an\\ninteresting mixture of emotions\\nand perceptions.

Bernier and the “Degenerate”\\nEast\\nIf Ibn Battuta chose to describe everything that\\nimpressed and excited him because of its novelty,\\nFrançois Bernier belonged to a different intellectual\\ntradition. He was far more preoccupied with\\ncomparing and contrasting what he saw in India\\nwith the situation in Europe in general and France\\nin particular, focusing on situations which he\\nconsidered depressing. His idea seems to have been\\nto influence policy-makers and the intelligentsia to\\nensure that they made what he considered to be the\\n“right” decisions.\\nBernier’s Travels in the Mughal Empire  is marked\\nby detailed observations, critical insights and\\nreflection. His account contains discussions trying\\nto place the history of the Mughals within some sort\\nof a universal framework. He constantly compared\\nMughal India with contemporary Europe, generally\\nemphasising the superiority of the latter. His\\nrepresentation of India works on the model of\\nbinary opposition, where India is presented as the\\ninverse of Europe. He also ordered the perceived\\ndifferences hierarchically, so that India appeared to\\nbe inferior to the Western world.\\n6.1 The question of landownership\\nAccording to Bernier, one of the fundamental\\ndifferences between Mughal India and Europe was\\nthe lack of private property in land in the former.\\nHe was a firm believer in the virtues of private\\nproperty, and saw crown ownership of land as\\nbeing harmful for both the state and its people. He\\nthought that in the Mughal Empire the emperor\\nowned all the land and distributed it among his\\nnobles, and that this had disastrous consequences\\nfor the economy and society. This perception was\\nnot unique to Bernier, but is found in most\\ntravellers’ accounts of the sixteenth and\\nseventeenth centuries.\\nOwing to crown ownership of land, argued Bernier,\\nlandholders could not pass on their land to their\\nchildren. So they were averse to any long-term\\ninvestment in the sustenance and expansion of\\nproduction. The absence of private property in land\\nhad, therefore, prevented the emergence of the class\\nof “improving” landlords (as in Western Europe) with\\nWidespread poverty\\nPelsaert, a Dutch traveller, visited\\nthe subcontinent during the early\\ndecades of the seventeenth\\ncentury . Lik e Bernier , he was\\nshocked to see the widespread\\npoverty,  “poverty so gr eat and\\nmiserable that the life of the\\npeople can be depicted or\\naccurately described only as the\\nhome of stark want and the\\ndwelling place of bitter woe”.\\nHolding the state responsible,\\nhe says: “So much is wrung\\nfrom the peasants that even dry\\nbread is scarcely left to fill\\ntheir stomachs.”\\nRationalised 2023-24\\n'),\n",

It had\\nled to the uniform ruination of agriculture, excessive\\noppression of the peasantry and a continuous decline\\nin the living standards of all sections of society, except\\nthe ruling aristocracy.\\nThe poor peasant\\nAn excerpt from Bernier’s description of the peasantry in\\nthe countryside:\\nOf the vast tracts of country constituting the empire of\\nHindustan, many are little more than sand, or barren\\nmountains, badly cultivated, and thinly populated.\\nEven a considerable portion of the good land remains\\nuntilled for want of labourers; many of whom perish in\\nconsequence of the bad treatment they experience\\nfrom Governors. The poor people, when they become\\nincapable of discharging the demands of their\\nrapacious lords, are not only often deprived of the\\nmeans of subsistence, but are also made to lose their\\nchildren, who are carried away as slaves. Thus, it\\nhappens that the peasantry, driven to despair by so\\nexcessive a tyranny , abandon the country .\\nIn this instance, Bernier was participating in\\ncontemporary debates in Europe concerning the nature\\nof state and society , and intended that his description of\\nMughal India would serve as a warning to those who did\\nnot recognise the “merits” of private pr operty.\\nAs an extension of this, Bernier described Indian\\nsociety as consisting of undifferentiated masses of\\nimpoverished people, subjugated by a small minority\\nof a very rich and powerful ruling class. Between\\nthe poorest of the poor and the richest of the rich,\\nthere was no social group or class worth the name.\\nBernier confidently asserted: “There is no middle\\nstate in India.”\\nSource 11\\n/circleright  What, according to Bernier, were the\\nproblems faced by peasants in the\\nsubcontinent?

And, all this was\\nbecause of one reason: crown ownership of land.\\nCuriously, none of the Mughal official documents\\nsuggest that the state was the sole owner of land.\\nFor instance, Abu’l Fazl, the sixteenth-century\\nofficial chronicler of Akbar’s reign, describes the land\\nrevenue as “remunerations of sovereignty”, a claim\\nmade by the ruler on his subjects for the protection\\nhe provided rather than as rent on land that he\\nowned. It is possible that European travellers\\nregarded such claims as rent because land revenue\\ndemands were often very high. However, this was\\nactually not a rent or even a land tax, but a tax on\\nthe crop (for more details, see Chapter 8).\\nBernier’s descriptions influenced Western\\ntheorists from the eighteenth century onwards.  The\\nFrench philosopher Montesquieu, for instance, used\\nthis account to develop the idea of oriental despotism,\\naccording to which rulers in Asia (the Orient or the\\nEast) enjoyed absolute authority over their subjects,\\nwho were kept in conditions of subjugation and\\npoverty, arguing that all land belonged to the king\\nand that private property was non-existent.\\nAccording to this view, everybody, except the emperor\\nand his nobles, barely managed to survive.\\nThis idea was further developed as the concept of\\nthe Asiatic mode of production by Karl Marx in the\\nnineteenth century. He argued that in India (and\\nother Asian countries), before colonialism, surplus\\nwas appropriated by the state. This led to the\\nemergence of a society that was composed of a large\\nnumber of autonomous and (internally) egalitarian\\nvillage communities. The imperial court presided\\nover these village communities, respecting their\\nautonomy as long as the flow of surplus was\\nunimpeded. This was regarded as a stagnant system.\\nHowever, as we will see (Chapter 8), this picture\\nof rural society was far from true. In fact, during\\nthe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, rural\\nsociety was characterised by considerable social and\\neconomic differentiation. At one end of the spectrum\\nwere the big zamindars, who enjoyed superior rights\\nin land and, at the other, the “untouchable” landless\\nA warning for Europe\\nBernier warned that if\\nEuropean kings followed the\\nMughal model:\\nTheir kingdoms would be\\nvery far from being well-\\ncultivated and peopled,\\nso well built, so rich, so\\npolite and flourishing as\\nwe see them.

In between was the big peasant, who used\\nhired labour and engaged in commodity production, and\\nthe smaller peasant who could barely produce for his\\nsubsistence.\\n6.2 A more complex social reality\\nWhile Bernier’s preoccupation with projecting the\\nMughal state as tyrannical is obvious, his descriptions\\noccasionally hint at a more complex social reality. For\\ninstance, he felt that artisans had no incentive to\\nimprove the quality of their manufactures, since profits\\nwere appropriated by the state. Manufactures were,\\nconsequently, everywhere in decline.  At the same time,\\nhe conceded that vast quantities of the world’s precious\\nmetals flowed into India, as manufactures were exported\\nin exchange for gold and silver. He also noticed the\\nexistence of a prosperous merchant community,\\nengaged in long-distance exchange.\\nSource 13\\nA different socio-economic scenario\\nRead this excerpt from Bernier’s description of both\\nagriculture and craft production:\\nIt is important to observe, that of this vast tract of country ,\\na large portion is extremely fertile; the large kingdom of\\nBengale (Bengal), for instance, surpassing Egypt itself, not\\nonly in the production of rice, corn, and other necessaries\\nof life, but of innumerable articles of commerce which are\\nnot cultivated in Egypt; such as silks, cotton, and indigo.\\nThere are also many parts of the Indies, where the\\npopulation is sufficiently abundant, and the land pretty well\\ntilled; and where the artisan, although naturally indolent,\\nis yet compelled by necessity or otherwise to employ himself\\nin manufacturing carpets, brocades, embroideries, gold\\nand silver cloths, and the various sorts of silk and cotton\\ngoods, which are used in the country or exported abroad.\\nIt should not escape notice that gold and silver , after\\ncirculating in every other quarter of the globe, come at\\nlength to be swallowed up, lost in some measure, in\\nHindustan.\\n/circleright  In what ways is the description in this excerpt\\ndifferent from that in Source 11?\\nTHROUGH THE EYES OF TRAVELLERS\\nFig. 5.12\\nA gold spoon studded with\\nemeralds and rubies, an\\nexample of the dexterity of\\nMughal artisans\\nRationalised 2023-24\\n'),\n",

He believed that these came\\ninto existence when the imperial court moved in\\nand rapidly declined when it moved out. He\\nsuggested that they did not have viable social and\\neconomic foundations but were dependent on\\nimperial patronage.\\nAs in the case of the question of landownership,\\nBernier was drawing an oversimplified picture.\\nThere were all kinds of towns: manufacturing\\ntowns, trading towns, port-towns, sacred centres,\\npilgrimage towns, etc. Their existence is an index\\nof the prosperity of merchant communities and\\nprofessional classes.\\nMerchants often had strong community or kin ties,\\nand were organised into their own caste-cum-\\noccupational bodies.

Some female slaves in the service of\\nthe Sultan were experts in music and dance,\\nand Ibn Battuta enjoyed their performance\\nat the wedding of the Sultan’s sister. Female\\nslaves were also employed by the Sultan to\\nkeep a watch on his nobles.\\nSlaves were generally used for domestic\\nlabour, and Ibn Battuta found their services\\nparticularly indispensable for carrying\\nwomen and men on palanquins or dola.

These he\\nclassified as part of  a great\\ntradition. At the same time,\\npeasants also followed local\\npractices that did not\\nnecessarily correspond with\\nthose of the great tradition.\\nThese he included within the\\ncategory of little tradition. He\\nalso noticed that both great\\nand little traditions changed\\nover time, through a process of\\ninteraction.\\nWhile scholars accept the\\nsignificance of these categories\\nand processes, they are\\noften uncomfortable with the\\nhierarchy suggested by the\\nterms great and little. The use\\nof quotation marks for “great”\\nand “little” is one way of\\nindicating this.\\n1. A Mosaic of Religious Beliefs\\nand Practices\\nPerhaps the most striking feature of this phase is\\nthe increasing visibility of a wide range of gods and\\ngoddesses in sculpture as well as in texts. At one\\nlevel, this indicates the continued and even extended\\nworship of the major deities – Vishnu, Shiva and\\nthe goddess – each of whom was visualised in a\\nvariety of forms.\\n1.1 The integration of cults\\nHistorians who have tried to understand these\\ndevelopments suggest that there were at least two\\nprocesses at work. One was a process of disseminating\\nBrahmanical ideas. This is exemplified by the\\ncomposition, compilation and preservation of Puranic\\ntexts in simple Sanskrit verse, explicitly meant to\\nbe accessible to women and Shudras, who were\\ngenerally excluded from Vedic learning. At the same\\ntime, there was a second process at work – that of\\nthe Brahmanas accepting and reworking the beliefs\\nand practices of these and other social categories. In\\nfact, many beliefs and practices were shaped through\\na continuous dialogue between what sociologists have\\ndescribed as “great” Sanskritic Puranic traditions\\nand “little” traditions throughout the land.\\nOne of the most striking examples of this process\\nis evident at Puri, Orissa, where the principal deity\\nwas identified, by the twelfth century, as Jagannatha\\n(literally, the lord of the world), a form of Vishnu.\\nFig. 6.2\\nJagannatha (extreme right) with his\\nsister Subhadra (centre) and his\\nbrother Balarama (left)\\nBHAKTI-SUFI TRADITIONS\\nRationalised 2023-24\\n'),\n",

In this instance, a local deity,\\nwhose image was and continues to be made of wood\\nby local tribal specialists, was recognised as a form\\nof Vishnu. At the same time, Vishnu was visualised\\nin a way that was very different from that in other\\nparts of the country.\\nSuch instances of integration are evident\\namongst goddess cults as well. W orship of the\\ngoddess, often simply in the form of a stone smeared\\nwith ochre, was evidently widespread. These local\\ndeities were often incorporated within the Puranic\\nframework by providing them with an identity as a\\nwife of the principal male deities – sometimes they\\nwere equated with Lakshmi, the wife of Vishnu, in\\nother instances, with Parvati, the wife of Shiva.\\n1.2 Difference and conflict\\nOften associated with the goddess were forms\\nof worship that were classified as Tantric. Tantric\\npractices were widespread in several parts of the\\nsubcontinent – they were open to women and\\nmen, and practitioners often ignored differences\\nof caste and class within the ritual context. Many\\nof these ideas influenced Shaivism as well as\\nBuddhism,  especially in the eastern, northern and\\nsouthern parts of the subcontinent.\\nAll of these somewhat divergent and even disparate\\nbeliefs and practices would  come to be classified as\\nHindu over the course of the next millennium. The\\ndivergence is perhaps most stark if we compare Vedic\\nand Puranic traditions. The principal deities of the\\nVedic pantheon, Agni, Indra and Soma, become\\nmarginal figures, rarely visible in textual or visual\\nrepresentations. And while we can catch a glimpse\\nof Vishnu, Shiva and the goddess in Vedic mantras,\\nthese have little in common with the elaborate\\nPuranic mythologies. However, in spite of these\\nobvious discr epancies, the V edas continued to be\\nrevered as authoritative.\\nNot surprisingly, there were sometimes conflicts as\\nwell –  those who valued the V edic tradition often\\ncondemned practices that went beyond the closely\\nregulated contact with the divine through the\\nperformance of sacrifices or precisely chanted mantras.\\nOn the other hand those engaged in Tantric practices\\nFig. 6.3\\nSculpture of a Buddhist goddess,\\nMarichi (c.tenth century, Bihar),\\nan example of the process of\\nintegration of different religious\\nbeliefs and practices\\nRationalised 2023-24\\n'),\n",

Also,\\ndevotees often tended to project their chosen deity,\\neither Vishnu or Shiva, as supreme. Relations with\\nother traditions, such as Buddhism or Jainism, were\\nalso often fraught with tension if not open conflict.\\nThe traditions of devotion or bhakti need to be\\nlocated within this context.  Devotional worship had\\na long history of almost a thousand years before\\nthe period we are considering. During this time,\\nexpressions of devotion ranged from the routine\\nworship of deities within temples to ecstatic\\nadoration where devotees attained a trance-like\\nstate. The singing and chanting of devotional\\ncompositions was often a part of such modes of\\nworship. This was particularly true of the Vaishnava\\nand Shaiva sects.\\n2. Poems of Prayer\\nEarly Traditions of Bhakti\\nIn the course of the evolution of these forms of\\nworship,  in many instances, poet-saints emerged\\nas leaders around whom there developed a\\ncommunity of devotees. Further, while Brahmanas\\nremained important intermediaries between gods and\\ndevotees in several forms of bhakti, these traditions\\nalso accommodated and acknowledged women and\\nthe “lower castes”, categories considered ineligible\\nfor liberation within the orthodox Brahmanical\\nframework. What also characterised traditions of\\nbhakti was a remarkable diversity.\\nAt a different level, historians of religion often\\nclassify bhakti traditions into two broad categories:\\nsaguna (with attributes) and nirguna (without\\nattributes) . The former included traditions that\\nfocused on the worship of specific deities such\\nas Shiva, Vishnu and his avatars (incarnations) and\\nforms of the goddess or Devi, all often conceptualised\\nin anthropomorphic forms. Nirguna bhakti on the\\nother hand was worship of an abstract form of god.\\n2.1 The Alvars and Nayanars of Tamil Nadu\\nSome of the earliest bhakti movements ( c. sixth\\ncentury) were led by the Alvars (literally, those who\\nare “immersed” in devotion to Vishnu) and Nayanars\\n(literally, leaders who were devotees of Shiva).

To some\\nextent this is corroborated by the fact that bhaktas\\nhailed from diverse social backgrounds ranging from\\nBrahmanas to artisans and cultivators and even\\nfrom castes considered “untouchable”.\\nThe importance of the traditions of the Alvars\\nand Nayanars was sometimes indicated by the\\nclaim that their compositions were as important\\nas the Vedas.

The Virashaiva Tradition\\nin K arnataka\\nThe twelfth century witnessed the emergence of a\\nnew movement in Karnataka, led by a Brahmana\\nnamed Basavanna (1106-68) who was a minister in\\nthe court of a Kalachuri ruler. His followers were\\nknown as Virashaivas (heroes of Shiva) or Lingayats\\n(wearers of the linga).\\nLingayats continue to be an important community\\nin the region to date. They worship Shiva in his\\nmanifestation as a linga, and men usually wear a\\nsmall linga in a silver case on a loop strung over the\\nleft shoulder . Those who ar e r evered include the\\njangama or wandering monks. Lingayats believe\\nthat on death the devotee will be united with Shiva\\nand will not return to this world. Therefore they do\\nnot practise funerary rites such as cremation,\\nprescribed in the Dharmashastras. Instead, they\\nceremonially bury their dead.\\nThe Lingayats challenged the idea of caste and\\nthe “pollution” attributed to certain groups by\\nBrahmanas. They also questioned the theory of\\nrebirth. These won them followers amongst those\\nwho were marginalised within the Brahmanical\\nsocial order. The Lingayats also encouraged certain\\npractices disapproved in the Dharmashastras,\\nsuch as post-puberty marriage and the remarriage\\nof widows.

Religious Ferment in\\nNorth India\\nDuring the same period, in north India deities such as\\nVishnu and Shiva were worshipped in temples, often built\\nwith the support of rulers. However, historians have not\\nfound evidence of anything resembling the compositions\\nof the Alvars and Nayanars till the fourteenth century.\\nHow do we account for this difference?\\nSome historians point out that in north India this\\nwas the period when several Rajput states emerged. In\\nmost of these states Brahmanas occupied positions of\\nimportance, performing a range of secular and ritual\\nfunctions. There seems to have been little or no attempt\\nto challenge their position directly.\\nAt the same time other\\nreligious leaders, who did not\\nfunction within the orthodox\\nBrahmanical framework, were\\ngaining ground. These included\\nthe Naths, Jogis and Siddhas.\\nMany of them came from\\nartisanal groups, including\\nweavers, who were becoming\\nincreasingly important with the\\ndevelopment of organised craft\\nproduction. Demand for such\\nproduction grew with the\\nemergence of new urban centres,\\nand long-distance trade with\\nCentral Asia and West Asia.\\nMany of these new religious\\nleaders questioned the\\nauthority of the Vedas, and\\nexpressed themselves in languages spoken by ordinary\\npeople, which developed over centuries into the ones\\nused today. However, in spite of their popularity these\\nreligious leaders were not in a position to win the\\nsupport of the ruling elites.\\nA new element in this situation was the coming of\\nthe Turks which culminated in the establishment of the\\nDelhi Sultanate (thirteenth century). This undermined\\nthe power of many of the Rajput states and the\\nBrahmanas who were associated with these kingdoms.\\nThis was accompanied by marked changes in the realm\\nof culture and religion. The coming of the sufis\\n(Section 6) was a significant part of these developments.\\nFig. 6.6\\nFragment of a page from the\\nQur’an, belonging to a\\nmanuscript dating to the\\neighth or ninth century\\nRationalised 2023-24\\n'),\n",

From the seventh century,\\nwith the advent of Islam, these regions became part\\nof what is often termed the Islamic world.\\n5.1 Faiths of rulers and subjects\\nOne axis of understanding the significance of these\\nconnections that is frequently adopted is to focus on\\nthe religions of ruling elites. In 711 an Arab general\\nnamed Muhammad Qasim conquered Sind, which\\nbecame part of the Caliph’s domain. Later (c. thirteenth\\ncentury) the Turks and Afghans established the\\nDelhi Sultanate. This was followed by the formation\\nof Sultanates in the Deccan and other parts of the\\nsubcontinent; Islam was an acknowledged religion of\\nrulers in several areas. This continued with the\\nestablishment of the Mughal Empire in the sixteenth\\ncentury as well as in many of the regional states that\\nemerged in the eighteenth century.\\nTheoretically, Muslim rulers were to be guided by\\nthe ulama, who were expected to ensure that they\\nruled according to the  shari‘a.

They paid a tax\\ncalled jizya and gained the right to be protected by\\nMuslims.  In India this status was extended to Hindus\\nas well. As you will see (Chapter 9), rulers such as\\nthe Mughals came to regard themselves as emperors\\nof not just Muslims but of all peoples.\\nIn effect, rulers often adopted a fairly flexible policy\\ntowards their subjects.

Institutionally,\\nthe sufis began to organise communities around the\\nhospice or khanqah (Persian) controlled by a teaching\\nmaster known as shaikh (in Arabic), pir or murshid (in\\nPersian). He enrolled disciples ( murids) and appointed\\na successor ( khalifa). He established rules for spiritual\\nconduct and interaction between inmates as well as\\nbetween laypersons and the master.\\nSufi silsilas began to crystallise in different parts of\\nthe Islamic world around the twelfth century. The word\\nsilsila literally  means a chain, signifying a continuous\\nlink between master and disciple, stretching as an\\nunbroken spiritual genealogy to the Prophet Muhammad.\\nIt was through this channel that spiritual power and\\nblessings were transmitted to devotees. Special rituals\\nof initiation were developed in which initiates took an\\noath of allegiance, wore a patched garment, and shaved\\ntheir hair.\\nWhen the shaikh died, his tomb-shrine ( dargah, a\\nPersian term meaning court) became the centre of\\ndevotion for his followers. This encouraged the practice\\nof pilgrimage or ziyarat  to his grave, particularly on\\nhis death anniversary or urs  (or marriage, signifying\\nthe union of his soul with God). This was because\\npeople believed that in death saints were united with\\nGod, and were thus closer to Him than when living.\\nPeople sought their blessings to attain material and\\nspiritual benefits. Thus evolved the cult of the shaikh\\nrevered as wali.\\nSufism and tasawwuf\\nSufism is an English word\\ncoined in the nineteenth\\ncentury. The wor d used for\\nSufism in Islamic texts is\\ntasawwuf . Historians have\\nunderstood this term in\\nseveral ways. According to\\nsome scholars, it is derived\\nfrom \\nsuf, meaning wool,\\nreferring to the coarse\\nwoollen clothes worn by\\nsufis.  Others derive it from\\nsafa, meaning purity . It may\\nalso have been derived from\\nsuffa, the platform outside\\nthe Prophet’s mosque,\\nwhere a group of close\\nfollowers assembled to learn\\nabout the faith.\\nNames of silsilas\\nMost sufi lineages were\\nnamed after a founding\\nfigure. For example, the\\nQadiri order was named\\nafter Shaikh Abd’ul Qadir\\nJilani. However , some lik e\\nthe Chishti  or der , wer e\\nnamed after the ir  place\\nof origin, in this case the\\ntown of Chisht in central\\nAfghanistan.\\nBHAKTI-SUFI TRADITIONS\\nRationalised 2023-24\\n'),\n",

However, this was by no means a situation of\\nabsolute isolation fr om political power . The sufis\\naccepted unsolicited grants and donations from the\\npolitical elites. The Sultans in turn set up charitable\\ntrusts (auqa f ) as endowments for  hospices and\\ngranted tax-free land ( inam).\\nThe Chishtis accepted donations in cash and kind.\\nRather than accumulate donations, they preferred\\nto use these fully on immediate requirements\\nsuch as food, clothes, living quarters and ritual\\nnecessities (such as sama‘). All this enhanced the\\nmoral authority of the shaikhs, which in turn\\nattracted people fr om all walks of life. Further , their\\npiety and scholarship, and people’s belief in their\\nmiraculous powers made sufis popular among the\\nmasses, whose support kings wished to secure.\\nKings did not simply need to demonstrate their\\nassociation with sufis; they also required legitimation\\nfrom them. When the Turks set up the Delhi\\nSultanate, they resisted the insistence of the ulama\\non imposing shari‘a  as state law because they\\nanticipated opposition from their subjects, the\\nmajority of whom were non-Muslims. The Sultans\\nthen sought out the sufis – who derived their\\nauthority directly from God – and did not depend on\\njurists to interpret the shari‘a.\\nBesides, it was believed that the auliya could\\nintercede with God in order to improve the material\\nand spiritual conditions of ordinary human beings.\\nThis explains why kings often wanted their tombs to\\nbe in the vicinity of sufi shrines and hospices.\\nHowever, there were instances of conflict between\\nthe Sultans and the sufis. To assert their authority,\\nboth expected that certain rituals be performed such\\nas prostration and kissing of the feet. Occasionally\\nthe sufi shaikh was addressed with high-sounding\\ntitles.

By the\\nnineteenth century, anthologies of verses attributed\\nto him circulated in print in regions as far apart as\\nBengal, Gujarat and Maharashtra.\\nKabir’s poems have survived in several languages\\nand dialects; and some are composed in the special\\nlanguage of nirguna poets, the sant bhasha. Others,\\nknown as ulatbansi  (upside-down sayings), are\\nwritten in a form in which everyday meanings\\nare inverted. These hint at the difficulties of\\ncapturing the nature of the Ultimate Reality in\\nwords: expressions such as “the lotus which blooms\\nwithout flower” or the “fire raging in the ocean” convey\\na sense of Kabir’s mystical experiences.\\nAlso striking is the range of traditions Kabir drew\\non to describe the Ultimate Reality. These include\\nIslam: he described the Ultimate Reality as Allah,\\nKhuda, Hazrat and Pir. He also used ter ms drawn\\nfrom Vedantic traditions, alakh (the unseen), nirakar\\n(formless), Brahman, Atman, etc. Other terms with\\nmystical connotations such as shabda (sound) or\\nshunya (emptiness) were drawn from yogic traditions.\\nThe One Lord\\nHere is a composition attributed\\nto Kabir:\\nTell me, br other , how can\\nthere be\\nNo one lord of the world\\nbut two?\\nWho led you so astray?\\nGod is called by many names:\\nNames like Allah, Ram,  Karim,\\nKeshav, Hari, and Hazrat.\\nGold may be shaped into\\nrings and bangles.\\nIsn’t it gold all the same?\\nDistinctions are only words\\nwe invent …\\nKabir says they are both\\nmistaken.\\nNeither can find the only\\nRam.

If you return to the\\nsources in this chapter , you will notice that they\\ninclude a wide variety, written in several different\\nlanguages and styles. They range from the\\napparently simple, direct language of the vachanas\\nof Basavanna to the or nate Persian of the farman of\\nthe Mughal emperors. Understanding each type of\\ntext requires different skills: apart from a familiarity\\nwith several languages, the historian has to be aware\\nof the subtle variations in style that characterise\\neach genre.\\nShankaradeva\\nIn the late fifteenth century ,\\nShankaradeva emerged as one\\nof the leading proponents of\\nVaishnavism in Assam.

This created\\nrelationships of cooperation, competition and\\nconflict among them. The sum of these agrarian\\nrelationships made up rural society.\\nAt the same time agencies from outside also\\nentered into the rural world. Most important among\\nthese was the Mughal state, which derived the\\nbulk of its income from agricultural production.\\nAgents of the state – revenue assessors, collectors,\\nrecord keepers – sought to control rural society so\\nas to ensure that cultivation took place and the\\nstate got its regular share of taxes from the\\nproduce. Since many crops were grown for sale,\\ntrade, money and markets entered the villages and\\nlinked the agricultural areas with the towns.\\n1. Peasants and Agricultural\\nProduction\\nThe basic unit of agricultural society was the village,\\ninhabited by peasants who performed the manifold\\nseasonal tasks that made up agricultural production\\nthroughout the year – tilling the soil, sowing seeds,\\nharvesting the cr op when it was ripe. Further , they\\ncontributed their labour to the production of\\nagro-based goods such as sugar and oil.\\nBut rural India was not characterised by settled\\npeasant production alone.

Our major source for\\nthe agrarian history of the sixteenth and early\\nseventeenth centuries are chronicles and documents\\nfrom the Mughal court (see also Chapter 9).\\nOne of the most important chronicles was the\\nAin-i Akbari  (in short the Ain, see also Section 8)\\nauthored by Akbar’s court historian Abu’l Fazl. This\\ntext meticulously recorded the arrangements made\\nby the state to ensure cultivation, to enable the\\ncollection of revenue by the agencies of the state\\nand to regulate the relationship between the state\\nand rural magnates, the zamindars.\\nThe central purpose of the Ain was to present a\\nvision of Akbar’s empire where social harmony was\\nprovided by a strong ruling class. Any revolt or assertion\\nof autonomous power against the Mughal state was,\\nin the eyes of the author of the Ain, predestined to fail.\\nIn other words, whatever we learn from the Ain about\\npeasants remains a view from the top.\\nFortunately, however, the account of the Ain can\\nbe supplemented by descriptions contained in sources\\nemanating from regions away from the Mughal\\ncapital. These include detailed revenue records from\\nGujarat, Maharashtra and Rajasthan dating from\\nthe seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Further,\\nthe extensive records of the East India Company (see\\nalso Chapter 10) provide us with useful descriptions\\nof agrarian relations in eastern India. All these\\nsources record instances of conflicts between\\npeasants, zamindars and the state.

People became\\npahi-kashta either out of choice – for example, when\\nterms of revenue in a distant village were more\\nfavourable – or out of compulsion – for example,\\nforced by economic distress after a famine.\\nSeldom did the average peasant of north India\\npossess more than a pair of bullocks and two\\nploughs; most possessed even less. In Gujarat\\npeasants possessing about six acres of land were\\nconsidered to be affluent; in Bengal, on the other\\nhand, five acres was the upper limit of an average\\npeasant farm; 10 acres would make one a rich asami.\\nCultivation was based on the principle of individual\\nownership. Peasant lands were bought and sold in\\nthe same way as the lands of other property owners.\\nThis nineteenth-century description of peasant\\nholdings in the Delhi-Agra region would apply equally\\nto the seventeenth century:\\nThe cultivating peasants ( asamis), who plough\\nup the fields, mark the limits of each field, for\\nidentification and demarcation, with borders of\\n(raised) earth, brick and thorn so that thousands\\nof such fields may be counted in a village.\\n1.3 Irrigation and technology\\nThe abundance of land, available labour and the\\nmobility of peasants were three factors that\\naccounted for the constant expansion of agriculture.\\nSince the primary purpose of agriculture is to feed\\npeople, basic staples such as rice, wheat or millets\\nwere the most frequently cultivated crops. Areas\\nwhich received 40 inches or more of rainfall a year\\nwere generally rice-producing zones, followed by\\nwheat and millets, corresponding to a descending\\nscale of precipitation.\\nMonsoons remained the backbone of Indian\\nagriculture, as they are even today.

One example was the wooden plough, which\\nwas light and easily assembled with an iron tip or\\ncoulter. It therefore did not make deep furrows, which\\npreserved the moisture better during the intensely\\nhot months. A drill, pulled by a pair of giant oxen,\\nwas used to plant seeds, but broadcasting of\\nseed was the most prevalent method. Hoeing and\\nweeding were done simultaneously using a narrow\\niron blade with a small wooden handle.\\n1.4 An abundance of crops\\nAgriculture was organised around two major\\nseasonal cycles, the kharif (autumn) and the rabi\\n(spring). This would mean that most regions,  except\\nthose terrains that were the most arid or\\ninhospitable, produced a minimum of two crops a\\nyear (do-fasla ), whereas some, where rainfall or\\nirrigation assured a continuous supply of water, even\\ngave three crops. This ensured an enormous variety\\nof produce. For instance, we are told in the Ain that\\nthe Mughal provinces of Agra produced 39 varieties\\nof crops and Delhi produced 43 over the two seasons.\\nBengal produced 50 varieties of rice alone.\\nHowever , the focus on the cultivation of basic\\nstaples did not mean that agriculture in medieval\\nIndia was only for subsistence. We often come across\\nthe term jins-i kamil (literally, perfect crops) in our\\nsources. The Mughal state also encouraged peasants\\nto cultivate such crops as they brought in more\\nrevenue. Crops such as cotton and sugarcane were\\njins-i kamil par excellence. Cotton was grown over a\\ngreat swathe of territory spread over central India\\nand the Deccan plateau, whereas Bengal was famous\\nfor its sugar. Such cash cr ops would also include\\nvarious sorts of oilseeds (for example, mustard) and\\nlentils.

The Village Community\\nThe above account makes it clear that agricultural\\nproduction involved the intensive participation and\\ninitiative of the peasantry. How did this affect the\\nstructure of agrarian relations in Mughal society?\\nTo find out, let us look at the social groups involved\\nin agricultural expansion, and at their relationships\\nand conflicts.\\nWe have seen that peasants held their lands in\\nindividual ownership. At the same time they belonged\\nto a collective village community as far as many\\naspects of their social existence were concerned.\\nThere were three constituents of this community –\\nthe cultivators, the panchayat, and the village\\nheadman (muqaddam or mandal).\\n2.1 Caste and the rural milieu\\nDeep inequities on the basis of caste and other caste-\\nlike distinctions meant that the cultivators were a\\nhighly heterogeneous group. Among those who tilled\\nthe land, there was a sizeable number who worked\\nas menials or agricultural\\nlabourers (majur).\\nDespite the abundance of\\ncultivable land, certain caste\\ngroups were assigned menial\\ntasks and thus relegated to\\npoverty. Though there was\\nno census at  that  time, the\\nlittle data that we have\\nsuggest that such groups\\ncomprised a large section of\\nthe village population, had\\nthe least resources and were\\nconstrained by their position\\nin the caste hierarchy, much\\nlike the Dalits of modern\\nIndia.

In Muslim communities menials like\\nthe halalkhoran (scavengers) were housed outside the\\nboundaries of the village; similarly the mallahzadas\\n(literally, sons of boatmen) in Bihar were comparable\\nto slaves.\\nThere was a direct correlation between caste,\\npoverty and social status at the lower strata of\\nsociety. Such correlations were not so marked at\\nintermediate levels. In a manual from seventeenth-\\ncentury Marwar, Rajputs are mentioned as peasants,\\nsharing the same space with Jats, who were accorded\\na lower status in the caste hierarchy. The Gauravas,\\nwho cultivated land around V rindavan (Uttar\\nPradesh), sought Rajput status in the seventeenth\\ncentury. Castes such as the Ahirs, Gujars and Malis\\nrose in the hierarchy because of the profitability of\\ncattle rearing and horticulture. In the eastern\\nregions, intermediate pastoral and fishing castes\\nlike the Sadgops and Kaivartas acquired the status\\nof peasants.\\n2.2 Panchayats and headmen\\nThe village panchayat was  an assembly of elders,\\nusually important people of the village with hereditary\\nrights over their property. In mixed-caste villages,\\nthe panchayat was usually a heterogeneous body. An\\noligarchy, the panchayat represented various castes\\nand communities in the village, though the village\\nmenial-cum-agricultural worker was unlikely to be\\nrepresented there. The decisions made by these\\npanchayats were binding on the members.\\nThe panchayat was headed by a headman known\\nas muqaddam or mandal. Some sources suggest that\\nthe headman was chosen through the consensus of\\nthe village elders, and that this choice had to be\\nratified by the zamindar. Headmen held office as long\\nas they enjoyed the confidence of the village elders,\\nfailing which they could be dismissed by them. The\\nchief function of the headman was to supervise the\\npreparation of village accounts, assisted by the\\naccountant or patwari of the panchayat.\\nThe panchayat  derived its funds from\\ncontributions made by individuals to a common\\nfinancial pool. These funds were used for defraying\\nthe costs of entertaining revenue officials who\\nvisited the village from time to time. Expenses for\\ncommunity welfare activities such as tiding over\\nCorrupt mandals\\nThe \\nmandals often misused their\\npositions. They were principally\\naccused of defrauding village\\naccounts in connivance with the\\npatwari, and for underassessing\\nthe revenue they owed from\\ntheir own lands in order to pass\\nthe additional burden on to the\\nsmaller cultivator.\\nRationalised 2023-24\\n'),\n",

Often these\\nfunds were also deployed in\\nconstruction of a bund or\\ndigging a canal which\\npeasants usually could not\\nafford to do on their own.\\nOne important function of\\nthe panchayat was to ensure\\nthat caste boundaries among\\nthe various communities\\ninhabiting the village were\\nupheld. In eastern India all\\nmarriages were held in the\\npresence of the mandal. In other words one of the\\nduties of the village headman was to oversee the\\nconduct of the members of the village community\\n“chiefly to prevent any offence against their caste”.\\nPanchayats also had the authority to levy fines\\nand inflict more serious forms of punishment like\\nexpulsion from the community. The latter was a\\ndrastic step and was in most cases meted out for a\\nlimited period. It meant that a person forced to leave\\nthe village became an outcaste and lost his right\\nto practise his profession. Such a measure was\\nintended as a deterrent to violation of caste norms.\\nIn addition to the village panchayat each caste\\nor jati in the village had its own jati panchayat.\\nThese panchayats wielded considerable power\\nin rural society. In Rajasthan jati panchayats\\narbitrated civil disputes between members of\\ndifferent castes. They mediated in contested claims\\non land, decided whether marriages were performed\\naccording to the norms laid down by a particular\\ncaste group, determined who had ritual precedence\\nin village functions, and so on.

In the eyes\\nof the petitioners the right to the basic minimum for\\nsurvival was sanctioned by custom.

In cases of excessive\\nrevenue demands, the panchayat\\noften suggested compromise. In\\ncases where reconciliation failed,\\npeasants took recourse to more\\ndrastic forms of resistance, such as\\ndeserting the village. The relatively\\neasy availability of uncultivated land\\nand the competition over labour\\nresources made this an effective\\nweapon in the hands of cultivators.\\n2.3 Village artisans\\nAnother interesting aspect of\\nthe village was the elaborate\\nrelationship of exchange between\\ndifferent producers. Marathi\\ndocuments and village surveys\\nmade in the early years of British\\nrule have revealed the existence of\\nsubstantial numbers of artisans,\\nsometimes as high as 25 per cent of\\nthe total households in the villages.\\nAt times, however, the distinction\\nbetween artisans and peasants in\\nvillage society was a fluid one, as\\nmany groups performed the tasks\\nof both.

Phases in the agricultural\\ncalendar when there was a relative lull in activity,\\nas between sowing and weeding or between weeding\\nand harvesting, were a time when cultivators could\\nengage in artisanal production.\\nVillage artisans – potters, blacksmiths, carpenters,\\nbarbers, even goldsmiths – provided specialised\\nservices in return for which they were compensated\\nby villagers by a variety of means. The most common\\nway of doing so was by giving them a share of the\\nharvest, or an allotment of land, perhaps cultivable\\nwastes, which was likely to be decided by the\\npanchayat. In Maharashtra such lands became the\\nartisans’ miras or watan –  their hereditary holding.\\nAnother variant of this was a system where\\nartisans and individual peasant households entered\\ninto a mutually negotiated system of remuneration,\\nmost of the time goods for services. For example,\\neighteenth-century records tell us of zamindars in\\nBengal who remunerated blacksmiths, carpenters,\\neven goldsmiths for their work by paying them “a\\nsmall daily allowance and diet money”. This later\\ncame to be described as the jajmani system,\\nthough the term was not in vogue in the sixteenth\\nand seventeenth centuries. Such evidence is\\ninteresting because it indicates the intricate ways\\nin which exchange networks operated at the\\nmicro-level of the village. Cash remuneration was\\nnot entir ely unknown  either.\\n2.4  A “little republic”?\\nHow does one understand the significance of the\\nvillage community? Some British officials in the\\nnineteenth century saw the village as a “little\\nrepublic” made up of fraternal partners sharing\\nresources and labour in a collective. However , this\\nwas not a sign of rural egalitarianism. There was\\nindividual ownership of assets and deep inequities\\nbased on caste and gender distinctions. A group\\nof powerful individuals decided the affairs of the\\nvillage, exploited the weaker sections and had the\\nauthority to dispense justice.\\nMore importantly, a cash nexus had already\\ndeveloped through trade between villages and towns.\\nIn the Mughal heartland too, revenue was assessed\\nand collected in cash.

Women in Agrarian Society\\nAs you may have observed in many different societies,\\nthe production process often involves men and\\nwomen performing certain specified roles. In the\\ncontexts that we are exploring, women and men had\\nto work shoulder to shoulder in the fields. Men\\ntilled and ploughed, while women sowed, weeded,\\nthreshed and winnowed the harvest. With the growth\\nof nucleated villages and expansion in individuated\\npeasant farming, which characterised medieval\\nIndian agriculture, the basis of production was the\\nlabour and resources of the entire household.\\nNaturally, a gendered segregation between the home\\n(for women) and the world (for men) was not possible\\nin this context. Nonetheless biases related to women’s\\nbiological functions did continue. Menstruating\\nwomen, for instance, were not allowed to touch the\\nplough or the potter’s wheel in western India, or\\nenter the groves where betel-leaves (paan ) were\\ngrown in Bengal.\\nArtisanal tasks such as spinning yarn, sifting and\\nkneading clay for pottery, and embroidery were among\\nthe many aspects of production dependent on female\\nlabour. The mor e commer cialised the pr oduct, the\\ngreater the demand on women’s labour to produce it.\\nIn fact, peasant and artisan women worked not only\\nin the fields, but even went to the houses of their\\nemployers or to the markets if necessary.\\nWomen were considered an important r esource in\\nagrarian society also because they were child bearers\\nin a society dependent on labour. At the same time,\\nhigh mortality rates among women – owing to\\nmalnutrition, frequent pregnancies, death during\\nchildbirth – often meant a shortage of wives. This\\nled to the emergence of social customs in peasant\\nand artisan communities that were distinct from\\nMoney in the village\\nThe seventeenth-century  French\\ntraveller Jean-Baptiste Tavernier\\nfound it remarkable that in\\n“India a village must be very small\\nindeed if it has not a money-\\nchanger called a Shroff .

Marriages in\\nmany rural communities required the payment of\\nbride-price rather than dowry to the bride’s family.\\nRemarriage was considered legitimate both among\\ndivorced and widowed women.\\nThe importance attached to women as a\\nreproductive force also meant that the fear of losing\\ncontrol over them was great. According to established\\nsocial norms, the household was headed by a male.\\nThus women were kept under strict control by the\\nmale members of the family and the community.\\nThey could inflict draconian punishments if they\\nsuspected infidelity on the part of women.\\nDocuments from Western India – Rajasthan, Gujarat\\nand Maharashtra – record petitions sent by women to\\nthe village panchayat, seeking redress and justice.\\nWives protested against the infidelity of their\\nhusbands or the neglect of the wife and children by\\nthe male head of the household, the grihasthi.

Though it is nearly impossible to\\nset an all-India average of the forest cover for this\\nperiod, informed conjectures based on contemporary\\nsources suggest an average of 40 per cent.\\nForest dwellers were termed jangli  in\\ncontemporary texts.

Rather, the ter m\\ndescribed those whose livelihood\\ncame from the gathering of forest\\nproduce, hunting and shifting\\nagriculture. These activities were\\nlargely season specific. Among the\\nBhils, for example, spring was reserved\\nfor collecting forest produce, summer\\nfor fishing, the monsoon months\\nfor cultivation, and autumn and\\nwinter for hunting.

The Zamindars\\nOur story of agrarian relations in Mughal India will\\nnot be complete without referring to a class of\\npeople in the countryside that lived off agriculture\\nbut did not participate directly in the processes of\\nagricultural production.

It also reflects a fairly large\\nrepresentation from the so-called intermediate castes,\\nas we saw earlier, as well as a liberal sprinkling of\\nMuslim zamindaris.\\nContemporary documents give an impression that\\nconquest may have been the source of the origin of\\nsome zamindaris. The dispossession of weaker people\\nby a powerful military chieftain was quite often a\\nway of expanding a zamindari. It is, however, unlikely\\nthat the state would have allowed such a show of\\naggression by a zamindar unless he had been\\nconfirmed by an imperial order (sanad).\\nMore important were the slow processes of\\nzamindari consolidation, which are also documented\\nin sources. These involved colonisation of new lands,\\nby transfer of rights, by order of the state and by\\npurchase. These were the processes which perhaps\\npermitted people belonging to the relatively “lower”\\ncastes to enter the rank of zamindars as zamindaris\\nwere bought and sold quite briskly in this period.\\nA combination of factors also allowed the\\nconsolidation of clan- or lineage-based zamindaris.\\nFor example, the Rajputs and Jats adopted these\\nstrategies to consolidate their control over vast\\nswathes of territory in northern India. Likewise,\\npeasant-pastoralists (like the Sadgops) carved out\\npowerful zamindaris in areas of central and south-\\nwestern Bengal.\\nZamindars spearheaded the colonisation of\\nagricultural land, and helped in settling cultivators\\nby providing them with the means of cultivation,\\nincluding cash loans. The buying and selling of\\nzamindaris accelerated the process of monetisation\\nin the countryside. In addition, zamindars sold the\\nproduce from their milkiyat lands. There is evidence\\nto show that zamindars often established markets (haats)\\nto which peasants also came to sell their produce.\\nAlthough there can be little doubt that zamindars\\nwere an exploitative class, their relationship with the\\npeasantry had an element of reciprocity, paternalism\\nand patronage. Two aspects reinforce this view. First,\\nthe bhakti saints, who eloquently condemned\\ncaste-based and other forms of oppression (see also\\nChapter 6), did not portray the zamindars (or,\\ninterestingly, the moneylender) as exploiters or\\noppressors of the peasantry.

Second, in a large number of agrarian uprisings\\nwhich erupted in north India in the seventeenth\\ncentury, zamindars often received the support of the\\npeasantry in their struggle against the state.\\n6. Land Revenue System\\nRevenue from the land was the economic mainstay\\nof the Mughal Empire. It was therefore vital for the\\nstate to create an administrative apparatus to ensure\\ncontrol over agricultural production, and to fix and\\ncollect revenue from across the length and breadth\\nof the rapidly expanding empire. This apparatus\\nincluded the office (daftar) of the diwan who was\\nresponsible for supervising the fiscal system of the\\nempire. Thus revenue officials and record keepers\\npenetrated the agricultural domain and became a\\ndecisive agent in shaping agrarian relations.\\nThe Mughal state tried to first acquire specific\\ninformation about the extent of the agricultural\\nlands in the empire and what these lands produced\\nbefore fixing the burden of taxes on people. The\\nland revenue arrangements consisted of two\\nstages – first, assessment and then actual collection.\\nThe jama was the amount assessed, as opposed to\\nhasil, the amount collected. In his list of duties of\\nthe amil-guzar or r evenue collector , Akbar decr eed\\nthat while he should strive to make cultivators pay\\nin cash, the option of payment in kind was also to\\nbe kept open. While fixing revenue, the attempt of\\nthe state was to maximise its claims. The scope of\\nactually realising these claims was, however ,\\nsometimes thwarted by local conditions.\\nBoth cultivated and cultivable lands were measured\\nin each province. The Ain compiled the aggregates of\\nsuch lands during Akbar’s rule. Efforts to measure\\nlands continued under subsequent emperors. For\\ninstance, in 1665, Aurangzeb expressly instructed his\\nrevenue officials to prepare annual records of the\\nnumber of cultivators in each village (Source 7).

That the manuscript\\nwas revised five times by the author would suggest\\na high degree of caution on the part of Abu’l Fazl\\nand a search for authenticity. For instance, oral\\ntestimonies were cross-checked and verified before\\nbeing incorporated as “facts” in the chronicle. In\\nthe quantitative sections, all numeric data were\\nreproduced in words so as to minimise the chances\\nof subsequent transcriptional errors.\\nHistorians who have carefully studied the Ain point\\nout that it is not without its problems. Numerous\\nerrors in totalling have been detected. These are\\nascribed to simple slips of arithmetic or of\\ntranscription by Abu’l Fazl’s assistants. These are\\ngenerally minor and do not detract from the overall\\nquantitative veracity of the manuals.\\nAnother limitation of the Ain is the somewhat\\nskewed nature of the quantitative data.  Data were\\nnot collected uniformly from all provinces. For\\ninstance, while for many subas detailed information\\nwas compiled about the caste composition of the\\nzamindars, such information is not available for\\nBengal and Orissa. Further, while the fiscal data\\nfrom the subas is remarkable for its richness, some\\nequally vital parameters such as prices and wages\\nfrom these same areas are not as well documented.\\nThe detailed list of prices and wages that the Ain\\ndoes provide is mainly derived from data pertaining\\nto areas in or around the imperial capital of Agra,\\nand is therefore of limited relevance for the rest of\\nthe country.\\nThese limitations notwithstanding, the Ain remains\\nan extraordinary document of its times. By providing\\nfascinating glimpses into the structure and\\norganisation of the Mughal Empire and by giving us\\nquantitative information about its products and\\npeople, Abu’l Fazl achieved a major breakthrough\\nin the tradition of medieval chroniclers who wrote\\nmostly about remarkable political events – wars,\\nconquests, political machinations, and dynastic\\nturmoil.
